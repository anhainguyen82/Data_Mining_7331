    \section{Business Understanding (10)}\label{business-understanding-10}

This dataset contains information from schools within the California
Department of Education. It specifically addresses school progress on
standardized tests in Mathematics during the 2017-2018 school year. In
part, the data will be used to support Local Education Agencies (LEA) in
identifying strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement; assist in
determining whether LEAs are eligible for assistance; and assist the
SSPI in determining whether LEAs are eligible for more intensive state
support/intervention. The school accountability system in California has
10 priorities. This dataset looks at one part of the 4th priority:
Student Achievement. The dataset used in this analysis pertains
specifically to its Mathematics curriculum and the progress made from
2017 school year and the 2018 school year.\\
From this dataset, we will look at how the state, each county, LEA, and
campus increased or decreased their average distance above or below the
passing standard score. This dataset also allows us to look at different
programs (English Learner, Socioeconomic Disadvantaged, Students with
Disabilities, Foster Youth, Homeless Youth) and race/ethnicities
(Black/African American, American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian,
Filipino, Hispanic, Pacific Islander, White, Multiples Races/Two or
More). This project will address what difference in performance progress
were seen between public and charter schools and its respective
population subgroups, as described above. The outcome from this will
give insight to California on the performance progress in order to help
lawmakers better fund schools.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Is one subgroup out/underperforming another?
\item
  How do districts compare performance wise? County Offices of
  Education? What about with subgroups?
\item
  Charter v. Traditional schools? What about with subgroups?
\item
  Any impacts/trends by \# of kids tested?
\end{itemize}

Data is important because - It tells you how students performed on the
CAASPP (state wide) test - It tells you what achievement/performance
gaps exist - so policy can be made to address these issues

    \section{Data Meaning Type (10)}\label{data-meaning-type-10}

\emph{An is putting this part together}

    \section{Data Quality (15)}\label{data-quality-15}

At first glance, you will notice that the `All' category total in any
line is less adding up all the lines for similar campuses. This is
happening because a student may be in several different categories
(i.e., a student may be White (WH), in foster care (FOS), be living in a
low socio-economic status (SED) and be served by special education (SWD)
-- student will `count' in 4 of the 16 categories listed). No edits were
needed for this phenomenon. Additionally, there were columns of data
that we choose to eliminate from the data altogether. There were 7
columns at the end of the dataset that give the data for the
``California Alternate Assessment''. This test is usually given to
students served by special education who have profound disabilities and
are unable to complete the same test as others. There are approximately
1\% of the total population who are included, and the data does not
support our current research, therefore, these columns are also deleted.
Next, we found a column of data called ``pairshare\_method''. If a
campus does not include students of a testing grade level (i.e. PK
campuses) or the campus only serves special populations (i.e., mental
health hospital), the data is often paired with another campus in the
district or charter. If we kept this data in our dataset, these would be
duplicates. Therefore, the lines of data were deleted and then the
column was deleted. There are many missing values, however, they are not
mistakes. The values that are missing appear when a population has 10 or
fewer students represented. When this occurs, the data is not calculated
for the purpose of this data file and state accountability ratings. As
we look at the data, you will notice some of the larger category
averages come out to NaN (Not a Number) because each individual total is
10 or fewer. We chose to delete these lines from our dataset because the
data we need to calculate is not included for these lines.

Simple Statistics (10) We ran df.describe() on the full dataset to
understand the range, average, and quartile of the numerical values. Due
to the way the data is setup, this doesn't give us very much
information. From this output, however, we can use the `count' to find
out the location of most of our `NaN'.

\textbf{I can talk about the stats done with the groupby data here but
we may want to run some more `simple statistics' here so that we have
more `baseline' before we jump to the `fancy' stuff.}

    \section{Visualize Attributes (15)}\label{visualize-attributes-15}

\textbf{Need more `basic' stuff\ldots{}the fancy stuff all belongs in
the description of the Joint Attributes} Maybe pull out a few of the
subpops and then take Charter and Public and run some stuff there.??
Just an idea. We need to visualize at least 5 attributes.

    \section{Explore Joint Attributes
(15)}\label{explore-joint-attributes-15}

In order to get a better look at the SchoolType and the studentgroup, we
used groupby to create a group-wise average. When we looked at these
data, we found some significant differences in the average distance from
passing between the different school types and student groups.\\
\textbf{One significant finding.... (mention drop in student in foster
care in charter schools)}

Additionally, we created a cross-tabulation chart to enable us to
visualize the information in barplot form. Seeing this visually, enabled
us to see the stark differences in the average distance from passing in
each school type. \textbf{Write up more detail about this too}

    \section{Explore Attributes and Class
(10)}\label{explore-attributes-and-class-10}

\textbf{Are we supposed to expand what we noticed above? How is this
different than the two sections above?}

    \section{New Features (5)}\label{new-features-5}

The data is presented in such a way that made comparing different school
types difficult. There are various columns with a 'Y' or blank entry,
each based on the data being from either a Charter School, County
Entity, or an Alternative School (3 separate columns). Additionally,
there is another column that tells us if the data is from either state,
district/LEA, or school (1 column). In order to get one label for each
line of data based on this data, a new feature was created called
SchoolType. The options created based on the 4 columns mentioned above
are Public, Charter, AltPublic, AltCharter, District, County, and State.

    \section{Exceptional Work (10)}\label{exceptional-work-10}

\textbf{This isn't really 'additional analyses' because it's the same
analysis on a smaller subset.... may need to dig a little deeper here.}
In order to better visualize the information from the student groups
column, we split the data into two different groupings. One grouping is
all race/ethnicity categories. The other grouping is all of the various
special programs that are measured. The "ALL" category was left out as
it is simply the average of the averages all together.
